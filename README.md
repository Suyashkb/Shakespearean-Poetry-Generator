# Shakespearean-Poetry-Generator
In collaboration with the Google Generative AI Learning Path, I undertook an exciting project to build a Shakespearean poetry generator. Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras libraries, I harnessed a dataset of over 1.1 million characters from Shakespeare's works to create an encoder-decoder neural network architecture. This architecture elegantly translated the essence of Shakespeare's language into arrays of vectors, which were then transformed back into poetic verses. The model's ability to generate new verses in Shakespearean style added a touch of modern innovation to timeless literature. This project not only honed my AI skills but also showcased my creative approach to blending classic artistry with cutting-edge technology.

The Shakespearean Poetry Generator is a Generative AI which creates poems absed on Shakespeareâ€™s writings it was created in collaboration with the Google Generative AI Learning Path. The model harnesses a dataset of of over 1.1 million characters from earlier works of Shakespeare and works on Encoder-Decoder neural Network architecture . the Encoder architecture converts characters into unique vectors fed into a neural network which is made using various tensorflow and keras layers. Once the model is prepared it generates new poetry in form of vectors which using decoder architecture are converted back into characters and given as output.

The neural network consists of GRU, Embedding and Dense Layer and optimisation is done using Adam optimiser.
